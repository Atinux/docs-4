You can deploy your [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) app on Fly with minimal effort, our CLI will do the heavy lifting. You can use your existing Nuxt app or you can [create one using the tutorial](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation) then come back here to deploy your app.

## _Generate the Nuxt app_

If you just want to see how Fly deployment works, follow these steps.

<%= partial "partials/launch", locals: { detected: "Nuxt", app_name: app_name } %>

<%= partial "partials/launched" %>
